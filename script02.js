They're often awake during the late hours of the night because they enjoy the peace that comes when the world starts to quiet down.

They get distracted rather easily, and often find themselves falling down a rabbit hol of any given subject. Even so, they are very self-sufficient people, capable of looking after themselves. Fox emojis pair well with other people. Although they are capable of many things, they're not afraid to admit they need help and ask others for favors.

Although their emotions are most definitely genuine, they've probably worked hard to present this happy persona in hopes to positively affect the people around them.
